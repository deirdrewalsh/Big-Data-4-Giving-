<p>This project aims to provide community-level data to donors and organizations that provide services. Started at ATXHack4Change 2016, we take census data to identify areas of need in our city to allow donors and non-profits to make informed decisions on how their dollars and efforts can impact our community. The initial product focuses on the city of Austin, Texas and census data on poverty. </p>

<p>Started with low poverty index.</p>

<p>Should be familiar with US census bureau and HUD (housing and urban development), make calls and grab data to put it on a map.
HUD arcgis server is a bit difficult to work with compared to other systems, the spatial reference system that they use (esri) is not the same as typical latitude and longitude coordinates. </p>

<p>Creating a backend to interact with the HUD API directly (7 separate data bases) so that the front-end can more easily retrieve information from a variety of databases.</p>

<p>Still trying to figure out how to convert between esri and wgs84. Looking at using terraformer library.</p>

<p>Understanding of Leaflet and Javascript to build a front end to visualize the data on the map, </p>
